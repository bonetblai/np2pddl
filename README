Configure the benchmarks you want in the file get_problem_directories:
  it is possible to adjust the graph size (number of nodes), the probability
  of an edge (Bollob√°s), and others depending on the domain.
Then, run 'setup'. Generating the PDDL problem
  with the default settings may take a while.
After this step, the folder 'problems' will contain the generated PDDL problems.

To solve these, the script solve_all may be useful: it takes the horizon windows
  limits into account when calling M to solve the problems.

The scripts bash_results.py and results.py (the latter receives a folder as argument)
    may be useful for analyzing the solutions.

The directory 'chromatic' has some of our benchmarks for determining the
  chromatic number of a graph using our k-colorability domain.
